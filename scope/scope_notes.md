# Project Scope Statement
## Background

It is difficult to quickly understand an unfamiliar network with many devices (i.e. what are all the devices, how are they connected, how can they be accessed) so that the network can be troubleshooted, monitored, adjusted, etc. with a full knowledge of what's on it.
Other solutions exist but require hardware from specific brands and for all devices to be of the same brand (Ubiquiti Unifi, Fritz Mesh, Aruba Airwaves)

## Aim

The aim is to contribute to/begin development on an open source network mapping, monitoring, and management tool. It will be able to find basic information about all devices on the network, display it in a user friendly map topology UI, and record that data over time. The tool will have a simple setup process and be able to run on any user machine.

## Objectives (SMART)



## Success Criteria

At minimum, success for the client would be developing a working version with the network scanning/mapping tool. Success will be measured by communicating with the client throughout development (demos, presentation, questions, etc) and receiving feedback on the suitability of the tool as it is developed. This will be translated into our formal scope documentation including user stories and goals for each sprint. The completion of these stories/goals will be used to measure the success of the project.

## Human Resources

We had contact with an engineer at CISCO who works on a similar product called Meraki. This provided valuable insight into the implementation level details of a project such as ours.
We will attempt to reach out to other companies that create similar products such as Ubiquiti, Fritz, Aruba and more to get further feedback and expert opinions.
Our facilitator also has experience working on a similar project, and has many helpful insights into the mechanics and potential implementation of the product.

## Other Resources

Other resources used for this project will mainly be those for learning, such as tutorials, written guides and articles on related topics.
We will also do extensive research into similar products such as Unify, AirWave, SolarWinds, Mesh and LogicMonitor.

## Reporting/Meeting Frequency

Client meetings will be twice weekly, Mondays at 3:30pm and Thursdays at 2:30pm.
