## User Types
Before fully defining the user stories, let's define a few types of users that will use the product in different ways and/or for different purposes.
- Basic users: Users with low to moderate technical experience (to be more clear, people who are quite comfortable using a computer, but not experts or highly knowledgable about networking) who want to visualise their home and/or small business network. They do this to check if any unknown devices are connected, to help troubleshoot basic connectivity issues, or to learn/out of interest. They should not be required to input data such as IP ranges or understand networking protocols.
- Advanced users: Computer enthusiasts, students, experts who have high technical experience and want to improve it. They want a convenient tool to visualise their network(s), monitor changes over time (coming and going devices), and to learn by exploring different network structures. They should be able to override automatic functions and control the tool at a low level. They want insights into what the tool is doing and how.
- Professional users: For example IT personnel, they have similar or greater knowledge to the advanced users, but want to use the tool for more and larger networks, to aid in gaining a quick understanding of an unfamiliar network and to help troubleshoot, manage, upgrade, merge, etc. a network. They want repeated actions such as discovering new networks and monitoring to require limited input, be mostly automatic and run independently to save the user time. They should be able to view large amounts of network data in a digestable format.
