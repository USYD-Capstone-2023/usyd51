# ieee-oui.txt -- IEEE Ethernet OUI-Vendor mapping file for arp-scan
#
# This file contains the IEEE Ethernet MAC address registry entries that are
# used to determine the Ethernet vendor for a given MAC address.
#
# Each line of this file contains an OUI-vendor mapping in the form:
#
# <MAC-Prefix><TAB><Vendor>
#
# Where <MAC-Prefix> is the prefix of the MAC address in hex, and <Vendor>
# is the name of the vendor.  The prefix can be of any length from two hex
# digits (one octet) to twelve hex digits (six octets, the entire Ethernet
# hardware address).
#
# The order of entries in this file are not important.
#
# arp-scan will attempt to match larger prefixes before trying to match
# smaller ones, and will stop at the first match.
#
# Blank lines and lines beginning with "#" are ignored.
#
# This file was automatically generated by get-oui at 2023-08-15 16:13:34
#
# Do not edit this file.  If you want to add additional MAC-Vendor mappings,
# edit the file mac-vendor.txt instead.
