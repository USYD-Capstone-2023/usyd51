### Report items

	- A few extra bits with it

### Presentation

- iterations of the project

### Testing
- tutor said depends on what client wants
	- we can just test logic 

### Client deployment
- instructions sent
	- any questions just ask
- Keep pushing through
	- need some more code done - a bit of catchup from report work
- Once the database is actually done, Cian can do more interesting things once it's done
- Discord bot can allow more things to be built ontop of our project.
