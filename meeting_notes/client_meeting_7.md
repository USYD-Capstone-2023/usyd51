# Client Meeting 7
11/09/2023 3:30pm - 3:50pm 

### Feedback
- take a break from identifying devices, focus on frontend

### Short demo
- label to signify ssid of network in top left
- network name in the topology view needs updating, same with ssid in top right
- settings cog in top right is wacky
	- will be settings menu later
- port scan is "interesting" (i dont think he likes it lmao)
- Again, don't worry about backend stuff this week, take a break, work on frontend.
	- flesh out the demo some more
- Swap interfaces doing the scans on?
	- can sort of, it doesn't like our tunnel?
	- change settings in wireguard allowed IPS add 100.123.222.0/24

### Questions
- database schema... primary key? what are you really looking for?
	- just use an incrementing ID for primary key, allow the user to make dupes
	- mapping to mac addresses will cause problems later
- easy installers and wizards?
	- get back to us


### Mid-sem break
- No meetings
- Continue working on it though
