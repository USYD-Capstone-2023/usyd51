# Group Meeting 3
20/08/23 4pm - 5:30pm

### Progress Report
- Good work so far on it
- Finalise a few things

### Future
- Think about how we're going to store and access data
	- let's start by just being able to access most recent data
	- we can get older data later

Some of us also did some work on the project at the end and after this meeting.
