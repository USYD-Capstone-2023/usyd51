### Q and A
 - web based or app? - web based, prototyped app?
 - Topology view of a connected (local) network - any and all devices connected to a local network, include relevant info and maybe some more detail.
 - graphical interface for the topology - look into how obsidian does it?
 - discord server to communicate? - Use discord for whatever, most Cian communication will be done through discord.
 - keep bit bucket < 50MB !! **NO IMAGES** !! This is for later github porting... github complains when a repo is >50MB
 - uni "meetings are compulsory" - are they really? - Cian is flexible, just keep him up to date with progress and direction.

### Some Tools
 - Fast resolver - give IP range, checks what devices are alive
 - Flask is ok - good start just to get things moving, will move to django, elixir, or node.js

### Youtube
 - pre meeting 1 min video - prep notes, can view progression
 - one per meeting
 - "this is what we've done, what we need to do, future plan"


### Other
 - good current scope (just topology), can expand later
 - Mivin and Thomas, outside uni and robotics masters, just watching along, also mentoring??
 - Any other questions, chuck them in the discord... be sure to ping cian if you want it seen.
