# Client Meeting 3
17/08/2023 2:30pm - 2:45pm

### Q&A
- Can we use nmap?
    - thats fine.
- Differentiating devices...?
    - don't look for open ports
    - check for services running on ports tho
        - would classify windows easily, they do random things on random ports.
    - there are way better ways tho
### Ubiquity
- snmp could get a bit more info

### Research progress
- Miraki look
- Solar Winds demo

### Code progress
- MAC Address
- IP
- scapy default gateway is funky, doesn't seem to get all devices, though it could be a uni network issue.

### Other
- p5js for interface perhaps - just pick one that'll work, and remain supported.
- Even solar winds needs a decent amount of input. We can rip a bunch from the computer tho
