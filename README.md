**COMP3888_TH16_01_P51 Network Visualisation - Capstone Project**

Welcome to the respository for our Network Visualisation project. We strive to develop a comprehensive networking product that allows easy and seemless visualisation of generic network topologies, which is vendor neutral.

We aim to have a product that is simplistic enough for people with very minimal network knowledge to determine major errors in their setup, while allowing experienced network admins to visualise the nuances in their systems.
